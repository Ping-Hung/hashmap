# Modern Processor
- Instruction count (# of instructions executed in run-time) is
  not a good performance metric for modern processor
  efficiency.
- **Fewer Instructions ≠ Faster Execution**

## X86 Properties
- Superscalar
- Out of Order
- Speculative
- Deeply pipelined
- Vectorized (SIMD)
- Memory heirarchy dominated

These properties enables some instructions to be handled differently.
