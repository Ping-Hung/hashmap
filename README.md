# HashMap
Hashmap implementation in C as an learning activity for learning  

1. **Multiplicative hashing behavior**: [multiplicative hashing](notes/hashing.md)
2. **Robin Hood Hashing**
3. **Memory layout & cache locality**
4. **Areana Allocator (object pool)**
5. **Basic probabilistic analysis of hashing**

# TODO
- [ ] Write Makefile(s) to automate build and test
- [ ] Implement 64-bit integer hashing using multiplicative hashing.
    - [ ] Apply the TDD cycle
    - [ ] Test/tryout the Makefile(s)' automation.
