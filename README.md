# HashMap
Hashmap implementation in C as an learning activity for learning  

1. **Multiplicative hashing behavior**
2. **Robin Hood Hashing**
3. **Memory layout & cache locality**
4. **Areana Allocator (object pool)**
5. **Basic probabilistic analysis of hashing**

# TODO
- [ ] Write Makefile(s) to automate build and test
- [ ] Implement 64-bit integer hashing using multiplicative hashing.
